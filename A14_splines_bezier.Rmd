## *PART I: Splines*

## Basic Spline Examples 

First, we can use the command `spline` to output the interpolated values at 1000 evenly distributed points between the first and last interpolation points:
```{r}
# interpolation points
x <- c(-2,-1.5,-.9,0.3,1,2.1,3.7,4,5)
y <- c(4,4,3,5,0,-2,2,0,0)
# plot points
plot(x,y,pch=19,col='dodgerblue',cex=1.2,ylim=c(min(y)-1,max(y)+1))
grid()
# plot natural cubic spline
lines(spline(x,y,n=1000,method='natural'),col='seagreen4')
```

We can also get the outputs at specific points of interest using `xout`:
```{r}
plot(x,y,pch=19,col='dodgerblue',cex=1.2,ylim=c(min(y)-1,max(y)+1))
grid()
points(spline(x,y,xout=c(1.1,1.2,1.3,3),method='natural'),col='black')
```

Another way to make the same plots is to use the command `splinefun` to return the entire spline function and then plot it wherever we like:
```{r}
# compute spline function
ncs<-splinefun(x,y,method='natural')
# evaluate it at points of interest
xx<-seq(-4,7,length=2000)
yy<-ncs(xx)
# plot points
plot(x,y,pch=19,col='dodgerblue',cex=1.2,xlim=c(-4,7),ylim=c(min(y)-1,max(y)+1))
grid()
# plot natural cubic spline
lines(xx,yy,col='seagreen4')
```

Have a look at the different methods:

* `natural`: natural cubic spline
* `fmm`: not-a-knot cubic spline
* `monoH.FC`: monotone cubic spline
* others
* No built-in method for clamped cubic spline

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Here are some interpolation points. Generate and plot the `natural`, `fmm`, and `monoH.FC` splines going through these points.
```{r}
n <- 10
x <- sort(runif(n))
y <- cumsum(abs(rnorm(n)))
plot(x,y,pch=20)
```

### Exercise 2
Here is some data on the thrust of a model rocket sampled every 3 seconds. Thrust is a reaction force measured here in newtons (or $kg\cdot m/s^2$). The integral of thrust over the interval is the total impulse of the rocket. For those interested, [here](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/rktenglab.html) is some more information.
```{r}
#Thrust T vs. time t of a model rocket
t <- c(0., 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9,0.95, 1.);
T <- c(0., 1., 5., 15., 33.5, 33., 16.5, 16., 16., 16., 16., 16., 6., 2.,0.)
plot(t,T,pch=20,col='tomato',xlab="t time (minutes)", ylab="T thrust (newtons)", main="Thrust Data from a Model Rocket",ylim=c(0,40))
```

a) Use `splinefun` to fit a not-a-knot cubic spline to the data and then plot the data with both the points shown above and the fitted cubic spline.

b) Use your spline function to output the interpolated thrust values at 15, 29, and 37 seconds

c) Use the command
```
integrate(yourSplineFunction, lower = 0, upper = 1)
```
to estimate the total impulse of the rocket. Does your estimate change drastically if you use a natural cubic spline instead? What if you only use every other interpolation point when building your spline?

### Exercise 3
This [article](http://columbiaeconomics.com/?s=spline) discusses how economists commonly use splines to convert quarterly data into monthly data.  One example the authors cite is the quarterly data on Personal Income in the US from [National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs)](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm).  The idea is that you have quarterly economic data and you want to use cubic splines to make reasonable estimates of the monthly economic values.  In the image below, the quarterly data are known and are given in red, along with a linear spline fitting the data points.  
```{r}
# Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, NIPA Table 2.1.
# Data is given quarterly: use splines to estimate monthly 
#http://chamberlaineconomics.com/2010/01/20/how-economists-convert-quarterly-data-into-monthly-cubic-spline-interpolation/

# Personal Income  ($Billions)
PI<-c(8379.6,8506.6 ,8644.2 ,8707.3 ,8859.0 ,8881.2 ,8880.6)
Quarters <- seq(1,3*length(PI),by=3)

plot(Quarters,PI,ylim=c(8200,9000),pch=19,col='red', 
     ylab='Personal Income ($Billion)',
     xlab='Months (since Jan 2000)')
axis(1,at=seq(1,3*length(PI)))
grid()
lines(Quarters,PI,type='l',col='gray')
```

Using a natural cubic spline, generate a plot like the one below that shows the interpolated values at the months in between the quarterly data.



## *PART II: Bézier Curves*

### Exercise 4

Run the following three lines in the console in order to include the `manipulate` package and source the functions `draw.one.bezier` and `bezier.interact` from the `365Functions.r` file:
```{r}
library(manipulate)
source("https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/365/365Functions.r")
bezier.interact()
```

If you click on the gear box on the top left of the plot, a graphical user interface will appear. It allows you to change the control points to see how the curve changes. Play with different parameters and discuss with your neighbor how the control points change the shape of the Bézier curve. What happens as you move the control farther away while keeping the same angle?

### Exercise 5

Here is an example of the function `draw.curve()`, which is also in `365Functions.r`:

```{r}
T <- rbind(
  c(150,640,150,600,200,520,250,600),
  c(250,600,285,660,300,620,350,620),
  c(350,620,400,620,400,700,350,680),
  c(350,680,300,660,150,700,150,630))

draw.curve(T)
```

* Figure out the syntax of the code
* Play with it a bit and change the shape of the figure
* Can you make a right angle at one of the knot points?
* Add a new knot point at the top of the figure
* Discuss: how does the code make a closed curve?

### Exercise 6

Here is an example of how to make some characters with Bézier curves. First, try to understand the code.

```{r}
letter.T <- rbind(
  c(237, 620, 237, 620, 237, 120, 237, 120), 
  c(237,120, 237, 35, 226, 24, 143, 19), 
  c(143, 19, 143, 19, 143, 0, 143, 0),
  c(143, 0, 143, 0, 435, 0, 435, 0), 
  c(435, 0,435, 0, 435, 19, 435, 19),
  c(435, 19, 353, 23, 339, 36, 339,109), 
  c(339, 109, 339, 108, 339, 620, 339, 620), 
  c(339, 620,339, 620, 393, 620, 393, 620), 
  c(393, 620, 507, 620, 529,602, 552, 492), 
  c(552, 492, 552, 492, 576, 492, 576, 492), 
  c(576, 492, 576, 492, 570, 662, 570, 662), 
  c(570, 662, 570,662, 6, 662, 6, 662), 
  c(6, 662, 6, 662, 0, 492, 0, 492),
  c(0, 492, 0, 492, 24, 492, 24, 492), 
  c(24, 492, 48, 602,71, 620, 183, 620), 
  c(183, 620, 183, 620, 237, 620, 237,620))

number.five <- rbind(
  c(149,597,149,597,149,597,345,597),
  c(345,597,361,597,365,599,368,606),

  c(397,702,382,681,372,676,351,676),
  c(351,676,351,676,351,676,142,676),
  c(142,676,33,439,142,676,33,439),
  c(33,439,32,438,32,436,32,434),
  c(32,434,32,428,35,426,44,426),
  c(44,426,74,426,109,420,149,408),

  c(121,0,205,0,282,27,333,78),
  c(333,78,378,123,399,180,399,256),
  c(399,256,399,327,381,372,333,422),

  c(112,512,112,512,149,597,149,597))

draw.letter <- function(T, npts = 10, ...) {
  pts = draw.beziers(T[, 1], T[, 3], T[, 5], T[, 7], T[, 2],T[, 4], T[, 6], T[, 8], npts = npts, ...)
  polygon(pts, col = rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.3),border="black",xlab=" ",ylab=" ")
}
# 
# draw.letter(letter.T)

polygon(pts2, col = rgb(0, 0.5, 0, 0.3),border="black",xlab=" ",ylab=" ")
```

* Can you change the color of the 5?
* Can you change its transparency?
